## Brian Mueller
#### Math Teacher
I have leveraged Applescripts to speed up many of my workflows. For example, the process of manually entering grades into a gradebook can be very time-consuming, but the code I've written helps me enter grades from a non-alphabetized stack of papers into an alphabetical gradebook. Also, I've had to reformat all of my lessons from a 4:3 screen to a 16:9 screen, so doing the same formatting to 15 lessons per week would typically be very time consuming. However, since computer are so good at repetition, the Applescripts I've written have made reformatting feel like magic.
